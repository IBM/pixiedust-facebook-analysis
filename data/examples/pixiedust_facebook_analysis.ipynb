    "# Analyze Facebook Data Using IBM Watson and IBM Data Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a three-part notebook written in `Python_3.5` meant to show how anyone can enrich and analyze a combined dataset of unstructured and structured information with IBM Watson and IBM Data Platform. For this example we are using a standard Facebook Analytics export which features texts from posts, articles and thumbnails, along with standard performance metrics such as likes, shares, and impressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part I** will use the Natual Language Understanding, Visual Recognition and Tone Analyzer Services from IBM Watson to enrich the Facebook Posts, Thumbnails, and Articles by pulling out `Emotion Tones`, `Social Tones`, `Language Tones`, `Entities`, `Keywords`, and `Document Sentiment`. The end result of Part I will be additional features and metrics we can test, analyze, and visualize in Part III. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part II** will be used to set up the visualizations and tests we will run in Part III. The end result of Part II will be multiple pandas DataFrames that will contain the values, and metrics needed to find insights from the Part III tests and experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part III** will include services from IBM's Data Platform, including IBM's own data visualization library PixieDust. In Part III we will run analysis on the data from the Facebook Analytics export, such as the number of likes, comments, shares, to the overall reach for each post, and will compare it to the enriched data we pulled in Part I.\n",

Our sample data doesn't have a significant number of data points, but these three charts demonstrate how you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recognize image classes that correlate to higher average post consumption.\n",

If you are not convinced that you should add ultramarine robot pictures to all of your articles, then you might want to do some research with a better data sample."
