# Uncover insights from Facebook with PixieDust and a cognitive Jupyter notebook

In this developer journey, we will use a Jupyter notebook to glean insights from a vast body of unstructured data.

We'll start with data exported from Facebook Analytics. We'll enrich the data with Watson’s Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Tone Analyzer.

We'll use the enriched data to answer questions like:

> What sentiment is most prevalent in the posts with the highest engagement performance?

> What are the relationships between social tone of article text, the main article entity, and engagement performance?

These types of insights are especially beneficial for marketing analysts who are interested in understanding and improving brand perception, product performance, customer satisfaction, and ways to engage their audiences.

It is important to note that this journey is meant to be used as a guided experiment, rather than an application with one set output. The standard Facebook Analytics export features text from posts, articles, and thumbnails, along with standard Facebook performance metrics such as likes, shares, and impressions. This unstructured content was then enriched with Watson APIs to extract keywords, entities, sentiment, and tone.

After data is enriched with Watson APIs, there are several different types of ways to analyze it. The Data Science Experience (DSX) provides a robust, yet flexible method of exploring the unstructured, enriched Facebook content.

This journey provides mock Facebook data, a notebook, and comes with 3 pre-built visualizations to jump start you with uncovering hidden insights.

When the reader has completed this journey, they will understand how to:

 * Read external data in to a DSX Jupyter notebook via DSX Object Storage and pandas DataFrames.
 * Use a Jupyter notebook and Watson APIs to enrich data unstructured data using:
     * [Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/visual-recognition.html)
     * [Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-understanding.html)
     * [Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer.html)
 * Write data from a pandas DataFrame in a DSX Jupyter notebook out to a file in DSX Object Storage.
 * Visualize and explore the enriched data with [PixieDust](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/pixiedust).

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ibm/pixiedust-facebook-analysis)

## 4. Add credentials

Find the notebook cell after `1.5. Add Service Credentials From Bluemix for Watson Services`.

Replace the five <add_...> placeholder values with information from the `Service Credentials` tab in Bluemix. Use your Bluemix dashboard to find each of the services and click on the `Service Credentials` tab. In some cases, you might need to create credentials with the `New Credential` option.

![](doc/source/images/add_credentials.png)

> Note: This cell is marked as a `hidden_cell` because it will contain sensitive credentials.

## 5. Add the CSV file

#### Add the CSV file to the notebook
Use `Find and Add Data` (look for the `10/01` icon)
and its `Files` tab. From there you can click
`browse` and add a .csv file from your computer.

![](doc/source/images/add_file.png)

> Note:  If you don't have your own data, you can get our example by cloning
this git repo. Look in the `data/example_input` directory.

#### Insert to code
Find the notebook cell after `2.1 Load data from Object Storage`. Place your cursor after `# Insert pandas DataFrame`. Make sure this cell is selected before inserting code.

Using the file that you added above (under the 10/01 Files tab),
use the `Insert to code` drop-down menu.
Select `Insert Pandas DataFrame` from the drop-down menu.

![](doc/source/images/insert_to_code.png)

> Note: This cell is marked as a hidden_cell because it contains
sensitive credentials.

![](doc/source/images/inserted_pandas.png)

#### Fix-up variable names
The inserted code includes a generated method with credentials and then calls
the generated method to set a variable with a name like `data_1`. If you do
additional inserts, the method can be re-used and the variable will change
(e.g. `data_2`).

Later in the notebook, we set `df = df_data_1`. So you might need to
fix the variable name `df_data_1` to match your inserted code.

#### Add file credentials

We want to write the enriched file to the same container that we used above. So now we'll use the same file drop-down to insert credentials. We'll use them later when we write out the enriched CSV file.

After the `df` setup, there is a cell to enter the file credentials.
Place your cursor after the `#insert credentials for file - Change to credentials_1` line. Make sure this cell is selected before inserting credentials.

Use the CSV file's drop-down menu again. This time select `Insert Credentials`.

![](doc/source/images/insert_file_credentials.png)

Note: This cell is marked as a `hidden_cell` because it contains sensitive credentials.

#### Fix-up variable names
The inserted code includes a dictionary with credentials assigned to a variable
with a name like `credentials_1`. It may have a different name (e.g. `credentials_2`).
Rename it or reassign it if needed. The notebook code assumes it will be `credentials_1`.

## 6. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
* At a scheduled time.
  * Press the `Schedule` button located in the top right section of your notebook
    panel. Here you can schedule your notebook to be executed once at some future
    time, or repeatedly at your specified interval.

## 7. Analyze the results

The result of running the notebook is a report which may be shared with or
without sharing the code. You can share the code for an audience that wants
to see how you came your conclusions. The text, code and output/charts are
combined in a single web page. For an audience that does not want to see the
code, you can share a web page that only shows text and output/charts.

### Data preparation

If you look through the code, you'll see that a lot of work went into preparing the data. 

### Visualization

Visualization with PixieDust...

### Stored documents

The enriched .CSV file was saved in DSX Object Storage.

## 8. Save and share

### How to save your work:

Under the `File` menu, there are several ways to save your notebook:

* `Save` will simply save the current state of your notebook, without any version
  information.
* `Save Version` will save your current state of your notebook with a version tag
  that contains a date and time stamp. Up to 10 versions of your notebook can be
  saved, each one retrievable by selecting the `Revert To Version` menu item.

### How to share your work:

You can share your notebook by selecting the “Share” button located in the top
right section of your notebook panel. The end result of this action will be a URL
link that will display a “read-only” version of your notebook. You have several
options to specify exactly what you want shared from your notebook:

* `Only text and output` will remove all code cells from the notebook view.
* `All content excluding sensitive code cells`  will remove any code cells
  that contain a *sensitive* tag. For example, `# @hidden_cell` is used to protect
  your Bluemix credentials from being shared.
* `All content, including code` displays the notebook as is.
* A variety of `download as` options are also available in the menu.
